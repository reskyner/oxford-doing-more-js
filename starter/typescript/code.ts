/*
- TYPESCRIPT 

- Install:                  npm install -g typescript
- Compile in watch mode:    tsc code.ts -w

- An optional type system for JS
- More understandable self-documenting code.
- Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- TS does not exist at run-time.

// TS offers 2 advantages:

// Generates compile-time errors EARLY in terminal inside editor (Visual Studio)
// Self-documenting code that describes your intentions to you/team.
